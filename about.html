                    <h1>Ruth Handler</h1>
                    <p>Ruth Handler realized her daughter's toy options were limited. She could only play at being a mother or caretaker, while her son had toys that let him imagine himself as a firefighter, astronaut, doctor and more. This inspired Ruth to create a doll that showed girls that they had choices - that they could be anything.

                    <p>The inspiration for creating Barbie came when Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara playing with dolls and imagining adult roles for them. Realizing the lack of realistic dolls on the market, Ruth decided to create a doll that could represent girls' aspirations and dreams. Thus was born Barbie, an elegant, confident and independent doll.</p>

                    <h1>Importance</h1>
                    <p>Barbie is not just a doll, but also a source of inspiration and empowerment for many people. She challenged gender stereotypes, encouraging girls to dream big and believe they can achieve any goal they set their minds to. Barbie also promoted inclusion by releasing dolls of different ethnicities, body types and abilities, promoting the idea that beauty lies in diversity.
